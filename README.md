# Improvements since Project 2.4

Users are now able to upload images with their reviews. When they delete their reviews, the images they uploaded are deleted too. Other users can view uploaded images for a particular beach in an 'Image Gallery' activity.

# Running the App

Simply import the project and run the app in an emulator.

After, you either sign in or register.

After sucessfully authenticating, you will be taken to a Map displaying the beaches. Here you will have to input your location (such as your address) and submit it. If the app has calibrated your location, it will show you a success message.


Otherwise something has gone wrong in inputting your address, and you may try again.

Once a valid address has been calibrated, and you have selected a valid beach, you will be able to select the beach, and from there you can leave reviews, discover routes to parking lots nearby, and even see walkable restaurants near the beach!
